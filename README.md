# a home for supplementary class materials 

This site is for you to learn, to study, and to enjoy the breadth of knowledge available on campus. 

Please upload or link to any resources that you find useful. Examples include study-guides, cheat-sheets, and online tutorials and notes.

## How to use
Click on a department page below to find relevant materials:
* [Asian American Studies](./asianamericanstudies)
* [Astronomy](./astronomy)
* [Biology](./biology)
* [Chemical Engineering](./chemicalengineering)



Remember: if you're using this site to study, remember that sometimes the act of making cheat-sheets is better than the cheat-sheet itself!)

## My course isn't listed!
That means we do not have any materials for that course. But please add your own.

## How to contribute
You can add to any existing page, or create a new one with a GitHub account. If you just want to share, email me at marwahaha@berkeley.edu .

Here's a great [15-minute tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com) on Markdown.

You can add your files in the `files/` folder. Please give it a descriptive name.
